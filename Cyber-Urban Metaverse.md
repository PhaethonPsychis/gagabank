# The cyber-urban Metaverse
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation 
#### Introduction
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life. In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership and unlock the full potential of societies.

#### What is the Cyber-urban metaverse?
It is a city that exists both in the real world and in cyberspace, as a single and consistent system and people who live in this city participate in both worlds using their avatar. 
Think of a community of people that contribute to the joint development of a city, as the metaverse version of a collective, a credit union or a cooperative. The metaverse is providing a path toward community governance of any kind of organization, private, public or non-profit. 
### What is the purpose of curban?
A Metaverse specifically created to fund design, develop, and operate urban developments in a policy framework that promotes new kinds of cooperation
and governance.

# Joint development of the Metaverse vision with participatory governance
We initiate a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.
### The MLV token

MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name. MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.

# Its time to build cyber-urban cities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.
