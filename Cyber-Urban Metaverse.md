# A Metaverse to create the cyber urban city
Cyber-urban metaverse is a metaverse populated by avatar representations of real people that contribute to the joint development of a new city, provide a body that oversee the development and operations, participate in the governance and get a share from the revenues generated. The cu metaverse is a collective owned and governed by the citizens it serves.

### cyber-urban metaverse has a one powerful purpose
Use the metaverse to fund, design, develop, operate and govern cities. Cities can be build in the virtual realm or to a physical geographical location

The Cyber-Urban Metaverse is a metaverse that is specifically designed to create a new era of cyber-urban life. It is also a group of technologies to create new urban environments that co exist on the cyber space and on a physical geographical location. 
In its final form it is used as a "platform" for managing the public realm in a virtual world and in the city we live as humans
 



# The Cyber-Urban Metaverse
A possible future form to consider is a large internet community of people building at some geopgraphical location a new city where the infrastrucutre and energy utility corporations are managed as metaverse collectives and citizens get a share of city's revenues.
The cyber-urban metaverse emerges as a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes like virtual land, and crypto domains, while enabling participation in cyber-urban collectives and trades accross realities.

# Joint development with participatory governance
We initiate a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.
### The MLV token
The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways. 
The MLV gives a voting right enabling community memebrs to express their views, vote for what they believe and excersize control. 
MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name. MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.
MLV tokens represent community resources that can be shared accross the network and is accepted by all participating services and products.
The MLV tokens ascommunity rewards create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.

### The Metaverse Lands 
A Virtual Land registry system to serve a community building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.

# Its time to build cyber-urban cities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.
