# The Cyber-Urban Metaverse
A possible future form to consider is a large internet community of people building at some geopgraphical location a new city where the infrastrucutre and energy utility corporations are managed as metaverse collectives and citizens get a share of city's revenues.
The cyber-urban metaverse emerges as a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes like virtual land, and crypto domains, while enabling participation in cyber-urban collectives and trades accross realities.

# Joint development with participatory governance
The metaverse starts as a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.

# Its time to build cyber-urban cities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.
