# ⚡️ Cyber Urban Land: A Metaverse
The Cyber Urban Land Metaverse—a group of technologies that encompasses blockchain cooperatives, digital assets, virtual land systems, decentralized governance, and social platforms— increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities<br> 

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the geographical urban space that allow people to coordinate actions towards a common goal, create, exchange, and take ownership of their digital assets and the public space<br>
In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of the cyber-physical space<br>

#### a new era of cyber-urban life
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks our capacity to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>

# 💎 The cyber-urban city
Think of the cyber urban city as a decentralized platform where any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be organized as a metaverse cooperative, collective or credit union. 
The cyber urban city exists both in the real world and in cyberspace, as a single and consistent system, and people who live in this city participate in both worlds using their avatars.
Think of a decentralised collective of people that contribute to the joint development of a city using the metaverse as a platform for governance and coordinatiion. Think of the metaverse as a platform where any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be organized as a native metaverse cooperative. The metaverse is used as a space for community participation and governance.

#### What is the purpose of curban Metaverse?
A Metaverse specifically created to fund design, develop, and operate urban developments in a policy framework that promotes new kinds of cooperation

# Joint development
We initiate a joint working program to build the metaverse for cyber-urban cities. We will use web3 tools to organize the community and help them create capacity.

### The ecosystem of our project
We start with the deployment of a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. 
We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.

### The CURB token. Innovative participation and reward system
The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>
### Metaverse addresses for avatars

### Metaverse Lands registry 
A Virtual Land registry system to serve a community building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.

# Its time to build cyber-urban realities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.
