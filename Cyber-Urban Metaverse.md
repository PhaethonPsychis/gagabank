# Joint development of the curb Metaverse with participatory governance
We initiate a joint working program to build the metaverse for cyber-urban cities. We will use web3 tools to organize the community and help them create capacity.

### The ecosystem of our project
We start with the deployment of a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. 
We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.

### The CURB token. Innovative participation and reward system
The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>
### Metaverse addresses for avatars

A Virtual Land registry system to serve a community building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.

# Its time to build cyber-urban realities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.
