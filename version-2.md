# ⚡️ A Metaverse for the cyberurban city
This metaverse is specifically created for the design of cities that exists both in a physical geographical location as urban environments, and in cyberspace. People who live in this metaverse participate in both worlds using their avatars<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the urban environment<br>

The metaverse is used as a platform for decentralised participatory systems to enable people to share ownership and govern the cyber-physical space and receive the earnings of the city<br>

In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of their city and the cyber space <br>

# 💎 A new era for cyberurban life
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>

# 🛠 Building and running cities: A blueprint for Urbanization
#### Collective development and fractional ownership of the city. Revenue sharing among citizens!
Think of the metaverse as a powerhouse that enables a decentralised collective of people contribute to the joint development of a city. 

Communities plugin and use the metaverse as as a platform to access a strategic policy framework for governance, and shared ownership.<br>

In the CyberUrban City any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be established as a cyber-cooperative. The meta city is a decentralised network of all these cooperatives. Metaverse operates as a platform for a decentralised governance framework, that has the potential to draw citizens from around the world to develop the city and the public goods or utility services<br>
The meta city cooperative is governed by communities from the metaverse and can reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals<br><br> 
Citizens interact with digital organizations through their avatar representations that live in the metaverse<br><br> 

#### What is the purpose of the CyberUrban City?
The CyberUrban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own.


# 👫 Decentralized Autonomous Working Group and Joint development Program  👫👫👫👫
We initiate a decentralized working group to start developing the discourse on the vision for Cyber Urban Cities.  
We invite Schools of Archtecture and Urban Planning, Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens to participate and contribute.<br><br> 
### Deliverables
-A strategic framework for collectively funding, developing, regulating and governing CyberUrban Cities that will lead to new ways of cyberurban living. A metaverse.
These deliverables are in software format. The code is and will always be, opensource for everyone to use, share or modify<br><br>

-Vision Projects combining Digital Crypto-Economic Zones and Urban developments in critical geographic locations governed through a Metaverse platform

-A decentralised Metaverse Lands system



This is a living document and we will update it as the community grows and the project evolves.<br>

But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.

# 🚀 Self Organizing Community: The ecosystem
We want to enable the organic formation of a self-organized permissionless working group where everyone can participate and contribute.  build the agendsOur aim is to incentivize people to participate and contribute in a self-organizing manner based on aligned incentives, common interests and personal growth. 
We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.



# Governance token $CYURBAN
The $LNDOG token is a governance token that allows holders to vote on the direction and implementation of the project. Hence $LNDOG is a tool for distributing the value and power over the development of the ecosystem to the community

The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
📢 Innovative participation.The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
💰 MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
