# ⚡️ The fractional city: A Metaverse
"This is a metaverse specifically designed to enable a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city, acquire fractional ownership of city's revenues, and participate in collective decision making. In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of their city and the cyber space <br><br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the physical urban environment at.<br><br>

The fractionalisation of the city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes in all three realities in the physical, cyber urban and virtual space. These multi dimensional assets are used for the collective governance, management and development of the city from the metaverse.<br>
The new cyber-urban city is a metaverse, that enables 


# 💎 A new era for cyber-urban life
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>
But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build!

# 🛠 Building and running cities: A blueprint for Urbanization
#### Collective development of a city. Fractional ownership. Revenue sharing among citizens!
Think of this metaverse as a powerhouse that communities can plug into and get power to build cities. This power is access to a cyber governance system that let people organize and fund the development of new cities.<br> 
Metaverse operates as a platform for decentralised governance that has the potential to draw citizens from around the world to develop the city and the public goods or utility services<br>

Any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be established as a metaverse-cooperative and allow for fractional ownership. The city is a decentralised network of all these cooperatives.<br> 

The meta city cooperative is governed by communities from the metaverse and can reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals<br><br> 
Citizens interact with digital organizations through their avatar representations that live in the metaverse<br><br> 

# 👫 Decentralized Autonomous Working Group for Joint development  👫👫👫👫
#### What is the purpose of the working group?
The fractional city offers a better model for how societies should develop cities, how citizens participate in the production and governance of public goods, and how the value created is distributed back to the citizens. Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own.
The aim of this working group is to study, research and develop the field of fractional cities and the CyberUrban Metaverse and build a prototype of a virtual city.<br> 
We want to enable the organic formation of a self-organized permissionless working group where everyone can participate and contribute. We are establishing a blockhain based autonomous ecosystem that allows participants to collaborate with each other to make decisions on the direction and implementation of the project.
We invite Schools of Archtecture and Urban Planning, Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens to participate and contribute.<br><br> 

### Fields of interest
⎔ This project category is in open source software format. The code is and will always be, opensource for everyone to use, share or modify<br><br>
 A strategic framework for governance and crypto assets regulation. EIP for digital cooperatives. 
 🚥 Architectural and Urban Planning competition: System of Cities, Digital Crypto-Economic Zones and Urban developments in critical geographic locations governed through a Metaverse platform

# 🚀 Incentives system and community coordination
  build the agendsOur aim is to incentivize people to participate and contribute in a self-organizing manner based on aligned incentives, common interests and personal growth. 
We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.

# Governance token $CYURBAN
The $LNDOG token is a governance token that allows holders to vote on the direction and implementation of the project. Hence $LNDOG is a tool for distributing the value and power over the development of the ecosystem to the community

The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
📢 Innovative participation.The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
💰 MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
