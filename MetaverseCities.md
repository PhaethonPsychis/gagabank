# ‚ö°Ô∏è Metaverse City
The CyberUrban metaverse is specifically created for cities that exists both in the physical geographical world and in cyberspace, as a single and consistent metaverse. People who live in this city participate in both worlds using their avatars<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the geographical urban space that allow people to coordinate actions towards a common goal, create, exchange, and take ownership of their digital assets and the public space<br><br>
In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of the cyber-physical space<br>

# üíé A new era for cyber-urban life
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks our capacity to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>

# A blueprint for Urbanization
Think of the city as a decentralized network where any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be established as a cooperative, collective or credit union on the metaverse. Citizens interact with digital organizations and participate in governance and socio-economic activities through their avatar representations that use the metaverse<br><br> 




####  the metaverse technologies?
The Cyber Urban Metaverse‚Äîa group of technologies that encompasses blockchain cooperatives, digital assets, virtual land systems, decentralized governance, and social platforms‚Äî increases our capacity to fund and develop entire new cities<br><br>




#### What is the purpose of this Metaverse?
This metaverse enables a decentralised collective of people contribute to the joint development of a city using the metaverse as a platform for governance and coordinatiion. 


#### What is the cyber-urban metaverse?
This metaverse is where the strategic policy framework is deployed and where constituents through their avatars live work, and play
#### What is the purpose of cyber-urban cities?
To create equitable economic growth and participatory governance systems


A Metaverse specifically created to fund design, develop, and operate urban developments in a policy framework that promotes new kinds of cooperation
and governance.

# Joint development
We initiate a joint working program to build the metaverse for cyber-urban cities. We will use web3 tools to organize the community and help them create capacity.

### The ecosystem of our project
We start with the deployment of a web3 platform populated by avatar representations of real people. Their purpose is to contribute to the joint development of the vision, and provide a highly efficient, auditable, form of governance. 
We provide an incentives system and some basic tools to allow the community formation from the ground up in an organic manner.

### The CURB token. Innovative participation and reward system
The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>
### Metaverse addresses for avatars

### Metaverse Lands registry 
A Virtual Land registry system to serve a community building platform facilitating social interaction, commerce, and entertainment.

# Its time to build cyber-urban realities  
The cyber-urban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop and operate cities to unlock greater economic prosperity and collective participation . Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own. Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens all need to collaborate in this work. 
But it‚Äôs time to begin. It‚Äôs time to build.
