# ⚡️ A Metaverse for the cyberurban city
This metaverse is specifically created for the design of cities that exists both in a physical geographical location as urban environments, and in cyberspace. People who live in this metaverse participate in both worlds using their avatars<br>

This innovation, still very early in its evolution, serves as the basis for the development of new forms of cities arising from the interaction of the virtual world and the urban environment<br>

The metaverse is used as a platform for decentralised participatory systems to enable people to share ownership and govern the cyber-physical space and receive the earnings of the city<br>

In its final form this metaverse is populated by avatar representations of real people that share ownership of their city and the cyber space <br>

# 💎 A new era for cyberurban life
The cyber-urban Metaverse is where and how contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules.<br>

# 🛠 A blueprint for Urbanization
Think of the metaverse as a powerhouse that enables a decentralised collective of people contribute to the joint development of a city. Communities plugin and use the metaverse as as a platform to access a strategic policy framework for governance, and shared ownership.<br>

In the CyberUrban City any kind of organization public, private, or nonprofit can be established as a cyber-cooperative. The meta city is a decentralised network of all these cooperatives. Metaverse operates as a platform for a decentralised governance framework, that has the potential to draw citizens from around the world to develop the city and the public goods or utility services<br>
The meta city cooperative is governed by communities from the metaverse and can reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals<br><br> 
Citizens interact with digital organizations through their avatar representations that live in the metaverse<br><br> 

#### What is the purpose of the CyberUrban City?
The purpose of the CyberUrban City is to lift millions of people out of poverty, create equitable economic growth, and develop new forms of cooperation and participatory governance.

# 👫 Joint development  👫👫👫👫
The CyberUrban metaverse offer a better vision for how societies should develop cities. Building that vision is a task too large and too important for any organization to tackle on its own.
We initiate a joint working program and we invite Architects, Coders, Policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, civil society organizations, and citizens to contribute. The code is and will always be, opensource for everyone to use, share or modify<br><br>
We will fix the working program as a community through online discusion and voting using metaverse native tools. Engaging in this procedures will help all build capacity and start experiencing the metaverse<br>
This is a live document and we will update it as community members join<br>

But it’s time to begin. It’s time to build.

The MLV community token enables holders to contribute in many ways<br>
📢 Innovative participation.The MLV gives a voting right to community members to express their views, vote for what they believe, and exercise control.<br> 
💰 MLV tokens represent community resources to share across the network where all participating services and products accept<br>
The MLV tokens create a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br>

🏗 MLV tokens are redeemable for metaverse land. You may exchange your MLV tokens to buy virtual land at a desirable address or a meta-domain name.<br>
MLV tokens can also be used to redeem future services, such as a participation certificate.<br>
