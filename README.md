# gagabank
Receive money. Transfer funds. You are the bank. A simple and powerful contract on the Ethereum blockchain that implements latest design patterns on bank accounts.
#### Design Principles
Increase security on blockchain transactions.</br>
Minimize the cost of contract deployment</br>
Minimize the transaction cost for the end user. How to do it? We reduce the gas consumption for the owner and the users. We use the Ethereum blockchain as a settlement and computation layer and not for storing data since the cost of block space is very high. We store data on an external database which is very cheap
